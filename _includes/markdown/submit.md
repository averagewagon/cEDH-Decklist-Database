# Submit a Deck
Lists that do not follow the requirements set in the ‘Website’ and ‘Description’ sections will not be reviewed. The decklist requirements are displayed to give you an idea of what types of decks we're looking for.  

> __Although the option exists to include multiple decklists in a single submission, please do not submit more than one. Submit your list, refresh the page, and then submit your second if necessary.__

## Decklist requirements:
- The list must be commander legal ‘out of the box’ (spoiled cards are fine, but only if they will be released before or right after the update).
- A strategy that has an expected winrate of around 25% in a competitive environment.
- Inclusion of all relevant staple cards for the strategy.
- No inclusions that don’t enhance the deck’s gameplan in some way.
- A commander that isn’t easily replaced by a stronger alternative.
- The ability to consistently interact with your opponents, or win the game, around turn three.
- Preferably no overreliance on the commander.

If you are submitting a "Historic" list for our records, please add "[HISTORIC]" to your deck title.

## Decklist website requirements:
- Needs to display ‘Last updated’ information.
- Does not require an account or additional steps to view lists, including custom filters and views that aren’t easily overwritten.
- List must be on Moxfield.

## Description requirements:
- Explain the main game plan and backup plan, preferably in relation to different parts of the game such as "establish draw engines in early turns".
- Explain the deck’s strengths, preferably by comparing it to other options.
- Explain the deck’s weaknesses, preferably by comparing it to other options.
- No more than 600 characters (to prevent scrolling).
- Do not refer to the deck in the third-person. If your list is accepted, this description will be used on the DDB.

Example: Narset Enlightened Exile tries to go for an Underworld Breach combo as soon as possible, preferably at turn two or three. If that fails, it utilizes Narset's recursion ability to establish a safer board state to go for another win attempt. In comparison to other decks in these colors, this deck struggles in the sheer card advantage department but can take that advantage from decks it interacts with. Narset is incredibly flexible, being able to pivot between game plans in the hands of a skilled pilot.

## When will my deck be reviewed?
You can see the next submission deadline, as well as estimated update dates, on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/BXPyu2P). Your deck can be reviewed at any point between its submission and the deadline.
