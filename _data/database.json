    "description": "Tatyova Turns is a midrange deck that aims to navigate the early game through interaction and playing key stax pieces, and is able to dominate the mid-late game thanks to having a very powerful value engine on the command zone that is able to draw a lot of cards without casting spells and functions through the most commonly played stax. It wins through generating an infinite turns loop or with a huge finale of devastation after making infinite mana/drawing your deck. The primer has all the combo lines explained.\n\nTatyova is a deck that focuses on lands, which is a unique arquetype not commonly seen in cedh that can be attractive to players trying to start on the format or looking for an unconventional cedh deck. With this deck I won Ka0s Treasure Series 7 in September 2023, proving that it is a viable cedh deck in the current meta.",
