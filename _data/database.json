It can use Ob Nixilis’ size to one shot opponents. This deck is reliant on Ob Nixilis, but if you resolve him early, then you will find yourself winning several games. It is slower than ad naus decks and decks that run rograkh, but it sees a lot more cards. It also has the major upside of using all will be one as a one card win.",

    "description": "Glarb let's you play lands and cast spells (Mana Value 4+) from the top of library, which makes him good for grinding out the long game. You're much more likely than most decks to hit your land drop every turn, and the restriction on his ability to cast spells still lets you cast The One Ring or Ad Naus. He also turns all your top-of-deck tutors into immediately castable, often game-winning, cards. The main win condition (other than Thoracle) is Doomsday. We can Gush for free from the top to break the pile, or just Finale of Devastation X=2 for Thoracle, leaving 3 cards left exactly (Glarb can surveil 2 more if we need to). There are as many piles as there are board states (in theory).",

Even if we reduce her abilities down to only one you will be surprised how versatile she is and how much impact she can have on the field. It is hard to break her down on only one strategy, we can choose between Underworld Breach, Ad Nauseam, Reanimation or even Doomsday (not in the deck currently).

Regardless of which one you're using, a Ring tempt trigger will be on the stack. Once it resolves, you choose the token that was just created to be your Ring Bearer, turning it into a legendary creature again. Sacrificing the token then repeats the process, creating a loop that can be used to win the game.

    "description": "Francisco Thrasios is a midrange deck that tries to use value engines to propel itself into the mid game, where it excels at winning over top of another opponent's win attempt. This is done by using Francisco and Walking Ballista combo to deal infinite damage at instant speed. We try to deploy draw engines in the early game to accrue value and sandbag protection. This deck's biggest strength is that, by using creature/artifact combos, we are hard to interact with. This deck's weakness is that we don't have access to white which would allow for stax to be able to build advantage in the early game.",

    "description": "Mardu Dargo is a midrange turbo deck that wins using explosive plays by sacrificing Dargo or following the classic Tymna grind plan. The deck abuses cards such as Burnt Offering, Sacrifice, and Altar of the Wretched to allow for massive payoffs or multiple win attempts on the same turn. If the initial win attempts fail, the deck pivots to using Tymna and Dargo to refill the hand. While this deck struggles into stax, Dargo can pressure life totals of those players to create a window. Pivoting is one of the greatest strengths this deck has due to the sheer density of wincons and lines of play.",
