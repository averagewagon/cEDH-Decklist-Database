EDH is increasing in popularity and a lot of people want to play with new commanders. While we'd like to see these new commanders represented, many lists aren't maintained after the initial hype period. 

The Brewer's Corner is a solution for many of these concerns. New entries that do not fit under any of the existing ones will go into the Brewer's Corner. In terms of deck evaluation, we will mostly be concerned with optimizing the commander, rather than comparing them to existing entries. We will still have general power level guidelines (for example, it will be hard to admit Isamaru despite how optimized a list might be), but they are less strict than our guidelines for older commanders.

Each review cycle, the managers and the reviewers revisit the entries in the Brewer's Corner. We'll look into how well the decks are maintained and perform, and how frequently they're played after the initial hype.
