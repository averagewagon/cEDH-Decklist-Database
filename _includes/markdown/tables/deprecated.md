The 'Database' category consists of two types of decks:
- Decks that are still viable within the current cEDH landscape, but are not impactful enough on the larger scale to be featured on the Main Page.
- 'Historic' decks that represent cEDH's many years of innovation and meta changes. Most lists here were at the top at one point but were impacted by bans.

Many of these lists still work in cEDH pods. They might just be not as popular compared to other options or simply need a caring owner/pilot/community to take the deck to the next level once more. cEDH is a vast format with many viable options for those willing to spend the time to learn.

If you see a deck in "Competitive" that you believe should be "Database" or visa versa, please report it in [Make a Request](/request) or visit our DDB Support Discord server and participate in related forum discussions.
