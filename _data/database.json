It wins through generating an infinite turns loop or with a huge finale of devastation after making infinite mana/drawing your deck. The primer has all the combo lines explained.\n\nTatyova is a deck that focuses on lands, which is a unique arquetype not commonly seen in cedh that can be attractive to players trying to start on the format or looking for an unconventional cedh deck.

    "description": "Dihada is a turbo deck with unique Breach Lines centered around Dihada, Binder of Wills. Dihada not only enables Breach Lines, but also fuels Reanimation strategies and allows you to have various tutor chains. After we have filled the yard, we can end the game in various ways. Her ability makes herself a great combo piece in Underworld Breach lines and also a great value piece giving your play more TURBO. Even if we reduce her abilities down to only one you will be surprised how versatile she is and how much impact she can have on the field. It is hard to break her down on only one strategy, we can choose between Underworld Breach, Ad Nauseam, Reanimation or even Doomsday (not in the deck currently). And the deck isn't overloaded because the strategies all evolve in parallel.",

When one of those creatures (mainly Samwise the Stouthearted, Gollum, Patient Plotter, or Boromir, Warden of the Tower) die, Ratadrabik will trigger, creating a non-legendary token that is a copy of that creature. Regardless of which one you're using, a Ring tempt trigger will be on the stack. Once it resolves, you choose the token that was just created to be your Ring Bearer, turning it into a legendary creature again. Sacrificing the token then repeats the process, creating a loop that can be used to win the game. Ratadrabik himself also offers a commander with inherent protection through Ward  and has a sizable enough body combined with vigilance to attack through and block most creatures in the format.",
