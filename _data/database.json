There are typical and atypical win lines that layer tightly on top of each other; it's common to convert value engines into combo cards, and the deck rewards ingenuity to play at a top level. The deck's strengths lie in having overwhelming card draw, powerful stack control, and its ability to pivot off of its value pieces. Its weaknesses lie in being mana hungry, being in pretty mid colors (lacking good tutors), and having a below-average early game. However, the deck can mulligan generously, as Plagon will refill the cards in your hand that you mulliganed away.",

In fact, this whole deck revolves around trying to get Lumra killed, like, a LOT. Since we can’t rely on our opponents to do this for us due to how enormous Lumra tends to get, we will have to take matters into our own lands cough I mean hands. Don’t be distracted by how big Lumra gets; having a 43/43 bear is certainly fun, but stay focused on the ultimate goal. The real path to victory lies in her ETB effect which allows us to manipulate our land count and their utility effects to win the game!

The deck wins using Ashaya, Soul of the Wilds & Quirion Ranger to infinitely rummage, Hedge Shredder & Golgari Grave-Troll to mill itself out, or various Underworld Breach lines, both Rydia-agnostic and her own unique versions.",

This deck's strategy is to leverage Loot's enormous utility in the command zone to out value and out politic everyone at the table.

The deck is designed to function effectively with and without Loot on the battlefield using an array of combos such as Food Chain, Dualcaster Mage, and Hullbreaker Horror.",

Terra, Magical Adept can adapt to both turbo and midrange strategies, performing reliably well in either approach. As a win condition, it can pivot to classic lines like Underworld Breach / Thassa's Oracle, or lean into its more unique identity with a Food Chain or clone loop using Terra’s back side. What sets this commander apart is the value engine it creates through milling and tutoring for enchantments.",
